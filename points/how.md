### How it works

Currently, there are two ways to get points. The first is if you create a micropractice, and then another user stars your micropractice. The second is if you become a cocontributor on another micropractice. In the future smaller actions will also result in points, such as liking a perspective comment, or adding references to an existing micropractice.
