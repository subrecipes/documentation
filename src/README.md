# Introduction

[https://subrecipes.org](https://subrecipes.org) is a platform for sharing narrow scoped best practice articles \(Recipes\). These recipes have a 5000 character limit to dissuade users from writing beyond a single idea, and they include first class support for updates with required versioning. Subrecipes also supports a perspective system - analogous to the issues section of many online version control platforms - which allows other users to expand on the initial ideas of the recipe. Finally, underpinning the entire Subrecipes platform is a points and rank system designed to encourage original contributions and collaboration.
